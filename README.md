A comprehensive **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of Amazon’s global sales data.
This project uncovers insights across **regions, item types, profits, order priorities, seasonal trends**, and operational performance metrics such as **processing time**.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

This project analyzes Amazon’s international sales dataset to answer key business questions including:

* Which regions generate the highest revenue?
* What items are most profitable?
* How do sales channels differ?
* Are there seasonal patterns in orders?
* Which countries experience longer processing times?
* How do unit price, units sold, and profit correlate?

The analysis is fully performed in a **Jupyter Notebook** using Python data science libraries.

## 📊 **Key Analysis Performed**

### **1. Data Cleaning & Preparation**

* Loaded raw CSV
* Removed duplicates
* Checked datatypes, missing values
* Basic descriptive statistics

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

The notebook answers the following questions through visualizations:

✔ Highest revenue-generating **regions**
✔ Profit contribution across **countries**
✔ Average **unit price & cost** per item
✔ Variation in **units sold** by country
✔ Effect of **sales channel** on order priority
✔ **Order processing time** across regions & channels
✔ Most & least **profitable item types**
✔ Correlation: **Unit Price vs Total Profit**
✔ **Seasonality** in order dates
✔ Distribution & **outliers** for pricing and cost
✔ Priority distribution across **item types and regions**

Each insight is represented using bar charts, line plots, histograms, boxplots, and correlation heatmaps.
